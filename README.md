# First+Third Front End Challenge

Well hello there! ðŸ‘‹

We want to assess your Front End proficiency and we've prepared this little test that should not take you a lot of time (ideally). It's a simple Newsletter subscription module.

We want to see your skills, specifically:

* Front End concerns
* Code semantics
* Modularity
* Attention to detail

As a requirement, the module should look good on any device and work properly.

To simplify the task, you can simulate that the form takes two seconds to submit and randomly notify that it has been submitted correctly, or that an error has occurred.    

Use either plain JavaScript or React but no other libraries since there should be no need these days. If you're taking the React route, please `useHooks` as that's what we would like to assess.

You might find a Sketch file too on the [assets](/assets) which you might be able to use on a Mac or you could use [Lunacy](https://icons8.com/lunacy) in Windows.
